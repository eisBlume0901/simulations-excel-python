Introduction to Modeling and Simulation

Modeling - process of creating an abstract representation of a real-world system or process
Simulation - execution of the model over time to study its behavior under various scenarios

Applications:
1. Weather forecasting
2. Disease spread prediction
3. Traffic flow optimization
4. Supply chain planning

Types of Models
1. Conceptual - high-level descriptions (e.g., flowcharts, diagrams)
2. Mathematical - represents systems using equations, inequalities, or probability distributions
3. Computational - implemented using software to perform calculatons and simulations

Key Elements of a Model
1. Variables - measurable quantities that can change (e.g., temperature, population size)
2. Parameters - constants that define system characteristics (e.g., growth rate)
3. Assumptions - conditions accepted as true for simplification (e.g., frictionless surface)
4. Constraints - limitations (e.g., budget, time, resources)

Formulating Real-World into Computational Models
1. Identify the Problem: Clearly state the objective (e.g., "Minimize wait times in a hospital ER")
2. Define System Boundaries: What's included/excluded int he model
3. Identify Variables & Parameters: Decide what data will be measured or estimated
4. Establish Assumptions: Simplify without losing essential accuracy
5. Translate into Mathematical Form:
  a. Equations (e.g., differential equations for population growth)
  b. Logical rules (e.g., if-else statements)
  c. Algorithm path

Types of Computational Models
a. Deterministic 
  - the output is fully determined by the intial conditions and parametsrs - there is no randomness involved. If you run it multiple times with the same inputs, you will always get exactly the same output
  - Examples:
  - Initial population: 1,000 
  - Annual Growth rate: 3%
  - How much is the population in 5 years?
  - Answer: 
    1,000 * 1.03 = 1,030
    1,030 * 1.03 = 1,061
    1,093 * 1.03 = 1,093
    1,093 * 1.03 = 1,125
    By 5 years, the total population would be 1,125

b. Probabilistic (Stochastic) 
  - incorporates random variables or uncertainty. Running the mode multiple times with the same parameters can produce different results because of the randomness
  - Example:
  - Rolling a 6-sided die 10 times using: =RANDBETWEEN(1,6) and get =AVERAGE()

c. Discrete 
  - if it changes in distinct steps or specific time intervals, and the variables take on distinct values (often integers)
  - time progression and events occur in jumps, not continuously
  - Example: Bank Queue Simulation

d. Continuous 
  - continuous when changes happen smoothly over time and variables can take on any value within a range
  - time is treated as a continuous variable
  - often uses differential equations to describe rate of change
  - Example Applications:
    a. Physics : Cooling of an object
    b. Biology: Population in 
    c. Environmental Science
  - Example Mathematical Function
  - Initial population = 1000

Scenario
1. Calculating the distance a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr for 3 hours.
Time Handling: Continuous - constant speed
Randomness: No
Model Type: Deterministic-Continuous

2. Predicting the number of defective items in a daily production batch.
Time Handling: Discrete - daily
Randomness: Yes - number of detective items
Model Type: Probabilistic-Discrete

3. Modeling the growth of bacteria in a petri dish under ideal laboratory conditions
Time Handling: Continuous
Randomness: No - ideal laboratory
Model Type: Deterministic-Continuous

4. Simulating the daily  number of customers entering a coffee shop
Time Handling: Discrete - daily
Randomness: Probabilistic - arrival time
Model Type: Probabilistic-Discrete

5. Tracking the amount of water in a tank being filed at a constant rate
Time Handling: Continuous - constant rate
Randomness: No 
Model Type: Deterministic-Continuous

6. Forecasting the time it takes for a comptuer to complete a given task when network delays are random
Time Handling: Discrete
Randomness: Yes
Model Type: Probabilistic-Discrete

Simulation Process: Step by Step
1. Define the simulation objectives
2. Build a conceptual model
3. Translate the conceptual model into a mathematical/computational model
4. Chooose a simulation tool (Excel, Python, MatLab)
5. Verify the model (check logic and implementation)
6. Validate the model (compare with real-world data)
7. Run experiemtns and record results
8. Analyze results and refine the model

Evaluation and Use of Simulation
1. Accuracy: Does the model produce results close to real data?
2. Reliability: Are results consistent across runs?
3. Usability: Is it understandable and practical for decision-making?
4. Ethical Considerations:
  a. Avoid bias in data and assumptions
  b. Disclose limitations and uncertainty
