Foundations of Computational Science

What is computational science?
- interdisciplinary, blending mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific sciences to model, simulate, and analyze real-world phenomena
- translating scientific challenges into computational tasks, it helps researchers and practitioners gain insights, make predictions, and optimize solutions across a wide range of fields - from physics and biology to social sciencesand engineering

Real-World Examples

Core Components
1. Problem Definition - understand the scientific or practical problem
2. Modeling - translate the problem into mathematical language
3. Discretization - approximate continuous models to make them solvable on a comptuer
4. Simulation - implement the model and run simulations
5. Analysis and Visualization - interpret the output and gain insights
6. Validation and Refinement - compare results to a real-world data and refine the model
